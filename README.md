This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the NAZRUG lecture on the Leaflet package.
The scripts for the leaflet demos may be found in Leaflet_Examples.R.
You will need to place the az_census folder in your working directory. Additionally,
I have included a basic template for a Shiny app using leaflet that can geolocate a 
user if they have a GPS equipped device.
